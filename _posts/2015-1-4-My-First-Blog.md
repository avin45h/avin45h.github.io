# And it begins..

So after years of procastrination, here I am, with my first blog. Well, uhm...
I am a web developer, a Senior one as per the Indian standards (However I still
consider myself to be a n00b Javascript Duke). I have well, pretty much worked
with C, Java, Shell scripting, Javascripting etcetera...

?? Why would I put up another blogging website while many others are there ??
    > Why not!

?? Why would you call yourself a duke and not a Ninja ??
    > Simple! Too many ninjas out there, and I own a Katoom Duke!

I am pretty much here for long, the reason being the community has taught me a
lot of things, and I guess I should contribute in one way or the other. I will
be posting in all my learnings over here, and let's see if this helps someone.
